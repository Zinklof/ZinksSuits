# Zinks Suits
### This is a small little mod making use of x537's More Suits mod. Mostly just to add in some suits for me and my friends.

## Currently included suits
- <b>Zink</b> <i><sub>(Based on my usual daily attire and Monster Energy addiction)</i><sub>
- <b>Zink Blue</b> <i><sub>(Just my favorite color as the entire texture)</i><sub>
- <b>Wrong Texture</b> <i><sub>(I exported the wrong texture in substance painter and just kinda.. went with it)</i><sub>
- <b>Pitch Black</b> <i><sub>(A solid texture of #000000, in all reality once in the game it doesn't seem to be all that dark after its run through the Material Shader and Unity's HDRP Post Processing (Plus whatever HLSL shaders the dev made himself))</i><sub>

There should be more to come inevitably once my friends ask for me to make them something, and when I get bored of working on whatever other random projects I'm working on, and thus decide to goof off making suits for this game.
